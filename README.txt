MARL (Music and Audio Research Lab) at NYU Music Technology program
is happy to release hundreds of human annotated chord labels to MIR researchers.

All chord transcriptions have been manually annotated by NYU undergraduate music students,
and each song has double checked by two annotators.


* Format
  Chord labels are annotated following Christopher Harte's chord notation rules that used in his famous Beatle dataset.

  The annotations are provided in two different file formats.

  - .lab files contain text format chord annotations in this form:

     start_time end_time chord_label

  - .svl files are for sonic-visualiser.


* Lists of chord annotated songs:
  You can check the list of annotated song titles in these files.
